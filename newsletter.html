    <div class="newsBody">
    What a busy month September was! The most important happening has been that I finally have a website. Credit for this must go to my youngest son, Patrick, who has been home with me for the summer months during his university holidays. Unfortunately with the current situation there was no going away to take a Workaway placement in Europe this year as he has done before. He has built the website from scratch, something that he had not done before. I’m delighted with it. It’s getting late in the year for flower deliveries, but it will be great to have the website up and running for next year and for my Christmas wreaths.

      <div class="underlineM"></div>
      <div class="newsletterBody" style="margin:0;">Planned for next year are some new raised beds for my cut flowers. Patrick has built these for me and we hope to get them in place and topped up with soil and garden compost in time for my spring sown annuals. I have four new beds which are five feet by eleven. I built a number of these beds myself when I first started growing flowers especially for cutting in my back garden a few years ago. Initially I grew only annuals and biennials in them and had all my perennial flowers in my front garden, but I have gradually discovered more and more beautiful perennial flowers that I want to grow, so some of these are now in the back garden.</div>

    <div class="headlineTitle1">Sowing Hardy Annuals</div>
    <div class="newsletterBody">
      A lot of my favourite hardy annuals can be sown late summer or early autumn and some will overwinter outside happily. The advantage of autumn sown annuals is that they put down a good root system over the winter and produce strong healthy plants which will bloom a little earlier than the same varieties sown in the spring. I have sowed a lot of my hardy annuals in the greenhouse already and some are planted out in the garden. Some will be kept in pots in the greenhouse over the winter. Overwintering hardy annuals outside is always a bit of a gamble as if we have a particularly hard winter they may not survive. I find that there are a lot of plants that will not mind cold temperatures, but they dislike being in wet soil for weeks on end. This is one of the reasons that I grow a lot of my flowers for cutting in raised beds as it is easier to ensure that the soil is well drained.

    <div class="headlineTitle1" style="margin-top: 4rem;">Daffodil Bulbs</div>
    <div class="newsletterBody">
      One job that I usually try to get done in September and have not managed to do this year is planting daffodil bulbs. I now have a lot of beautiful daffodils and narcissi naturalised in the less cultivated areas of my garden, but I like to trial some new varieties in pots each year. Unfortunately my order of daffodil bulbs was delayed this year, but they will be fine planted any time throughout October.

  <div class="newsletterBody" style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    The arrangements in the photos are all from flowers cut during September. My dahlias were planted very late this year but they have started to bloom. My favourite sunflower, ‘Valentine’ has been amazingly prolific this year and my calendulas have also been especially good. Some of my roses were having a bit of a break earlier this month, but had a nice second flush of blooms towards the end of the month. How much longer I will have flowers to cut depends entirely on the weather. Some years I have been able to make up posies and bouquets throughout October and even early November but if we have a hard frost or strong autumn winds that will be the end of my flower season. We shall see what October brings!
